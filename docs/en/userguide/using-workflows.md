# Using workflows

## Requesting publication (authors)

Depending on the specific permissions content authors have, authors may only have the ability to create or edit content 
and to request publication, but not to actually publish content - making it publicly viewable - themselves.

 * **Content Author - Non-admin**: To request publication, press the "Apply for Approval" button (or equivalent, 
 depending on how your workflow has been setup) in the same bottom menu of the Editing Pane.
 * **Content Publisher - Admin**: You will be asked to add a comment about your edits. This comment will become a part of the audit trail for your content, and we recommend adding this information.
However, it is not enforced, and you can safely proceed while leaving this field blank.

Depending on how your workflow is setup, users and/or groups configured with "approval" permissions will be alerted via 
email. They are able to login to the CMS and see your page as a pending approval request when they view the Workflow 
lefthand navigation menu item in the CMS. The publisher will then need to review your request and publish it.

## Approving and publishing content (publishers)

Depending on the setup of workflow, Content Publishers may receive an e-mail when Content Authors have requested 
publication. Publishers then select the 'Workflow' navigation item to view a report of pending items and by selecting 
one from the list, are able to access the approval step. In the following screen, the drop-down menu will display the 
next approval step based on the workflow for this page. Publishers are also able to enter in comments here, detailing 
their approval or cancel/deny the approval, if necessary.
